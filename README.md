# Final Project for IT 125 (Using SQL and SQL Server)
### Group project with Keith Chirayus, Megan Laine, and Rita Yatina
### March 2019

_Description_: A sample database for a small medical office.

#### Assumptions:
*	Patient (pt) can have more than 1 type of insurance
*	Doctor (dr) can have more than 1 type of practice specialty
*	Different insurance companies might only pay X percent of the clinic’s appointment charge
*	We won’t consider different insurance plan tiers at this time
*	This database doesn’t cover the full electronic health record
*	Appointments (appt) come in different types (ie Annual, Urgent, Well-Child, etc)
*	Diagnoses (dx) can be identified uniquely by ICD-10 code (there are over 68,000 codes, therefore ENUM is not suitable). We’ll use a 3-character version.

#### Included:
* Final MySQL code with database definition language (DDL) and database manipulation language (DML)
* Final powerpoint slides presented to class
* Final enhanced entity relationship diagram (EER)
